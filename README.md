#Variables

- Variables are containers for storing data values.

- A variable is created the moment you first assign a value to it.

For example:

`a = 12
 b = 15`

so if we enter `print(a)`
we should expect to get the number 12 as we have attached the value
12 to the letter 'a' and so on.

- We can also overwrite variables by entering a new one so the most update variable print will be the most recent for example:
`print(a)` we would get 12
a=4
`print(a)` now we would get the value 4.

### User input

You can also get user input by entering the following
`print("Hi what is your name?")` - (After users name can be stored as variable)
`name = input()`
`print("hi")`
`print(name)`
